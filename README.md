## Introduction

Predicting second-hand car prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. This project offers a solution by utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model trained on a dataset of second-hand car listings. The model provides accurate price predictions based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of a comprehensive collection of second-hand car listings. It contains information about various attributes of the cars, including their brands, models, manufacturing years, mileage, fuel types, transmission types, and prices.
